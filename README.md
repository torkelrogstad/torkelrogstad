## Hi there 👋

I'm the co-founder of [NGU Teknologier](https://ngu-tek.no), a company dedicated
to bitcoin. We're developing [Bare Bitcoin](https://barebitcoin.no) _("Just
Bitcoin", in Norwegian)_ a soon-to-be launched Bitcoin service for the Norwegian
market.

In addition to this, I do software consulting. I'm available for short-to-medium
term engagements in the bitcoin and crypto industries. Feel free to reach out if
you're in the market for this.

## Technologies and platforms 🧪

- **Lightning network** ⚡  
  Been involved with the Bitcoin Lightning network for several years.
  Contributed to OG Lightning wallet
  [Zap](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop) in
  [November 2017](https://github.com/LN-Zap/zap-desktop/commit/0e5141087997f56b97d37b222c03e2704241e936)
  and did my first mainnet payment in
  [January 2018](https://twitter.com/torkelrogstad/status/957769127233499141).
  I've worked on payment processing applications, exchange integrations and
  contributed to [several](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/4177)
  [open source](https://github.com/apotdevin/thunderhub/pull/92)
  [projects](https://github.com/jamaljsr/polar/pull/295).

- **Fireblocks** 🔥  
  worked on a hot wallet infrastructure revamp for a crypto exchange, migrating
  them from a self-rolled hot wallet setup to a platform based on the Fireblocks
  MPC custody platform. Allowed them to move faster without having to spend time
  provisioning and managing blockchain infrastructure, while enhancing the
  stability and reliability of their services.

## Languages & skills 📚

Over the years I've worked professionally with a few different languages, for a
wide variety of tasks and projects.

- **Go**  
  Advanced knowledge and experience, as my main programming language for several
  years. Worked on both greenfield and legacy systems, with a wide variety of
  topics: designing and implementing gRPC & REST APIs, micro services, batch
  processing jobs,
  [open source libraries](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Atorkelrogstad+archived%3Afalse+is%3Apublic+is%3Aclosed+user%3Astretchr),
  [bitcoin projects](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atorkelrogstad+user%3Abtcsuite+user%3Alightningnetwork).
- **gRPC/Protobuf**  
  Extensive experience over several years, both with consuming and producing
  APIs with gRPC and Protobuf. A big fan of using [Buf](https://buf.build/) in
  particular, for easy collaboration and communication across an organization.
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**  
  Frontend _(React, React Native, Next.js, Vue)_ and backend (Node.js).
  Everything from landing pages and admin dashboards to integrating gRPC micro
  services into legacy Node.js monoliths no one really understands anymore.
- **Scala**  
  APIs, streaming data,
  [bitcoin wallets and libraries](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Atorkelrogstad+archived%3Afalse+is%3Apublic+is%3Aclosed+user%3Abitcoin-s+).
- **SQL (Postgres)**
